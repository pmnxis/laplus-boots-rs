# The above dependency configurations are intentionally set to an external address in this repository
# for the purpose of compiling both the original and NDA code simultaneously.
# However, in reality, during a regular build, due to the patched content in `.cargo/config.toml`,
# the code accesses the locally stored directory directly without connecting to the URL.
# details : https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section
